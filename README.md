# Okay, Super!

Here is where the project files and music files of all Okay, Super! music shall reside.

Any changes made to the main branch of this repository MUST be UNANIMOUSLY approved by all core members of Okay, Super!


The directory structure should be:

- song_name
    - projects
        - project file type (cubase, audacity, etc.)
            - project files/directories (e.g. "words.au" as an Audacity file for Words, along with other necessary files for the project to be workable)
    - mixdowns
        - song file output (.wav, .mp3, etc.)


If, for whatever reason you wish to make a change or addition to any file in this repository that
you do not believe would be unanimous right away, feel free to create your own branch and/or fork this repository.
Try to name your branch or your fork as a play on the name "Okay, Super!"

For example, "Okay, Fwooper!" or "okay... super" or "hohkay, duper!"

We could spawn an infinite number of side projects using these same files, without requiring each core member to
directly partake in any of them.

Note that anything you add into this repository could be used in any side project variant of Okay, Super!
Still, remember that any updates to the officially named "Okay, Super!" must be UNANIMOUSLY approved.



## Recommendations

- Instead of adding version numbers to a song, try to use a different name (like going from Dr. Pepper to Picket Fences).
This way, different versions of the same song can take on unique identities that don't entirely replace each other.

- stick to the directory structure of the main branch, even in your own custom branches/forks

- name each custom fork or branch without using your name (don't just call your branch the "gene" or the "calvin" branch. Come up with another variant of Okay, Super! like the "okay_looper" branch, for example)
