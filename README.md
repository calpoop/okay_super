# Okay, Super!

Here is where the project files and music files of all Okay, Super! music shall reside.

Any changes made to the main branch of this repository MUST be UNANIMOUSLY approved by all core members of Okay, Super!


The directory structure should be:

- song_name
    - projects
        - project file type (cubase, audacity, etc.)
            - project files (e.g. "words.au" as an Audacity file for Words)
    - mixdowns
        - song file output (.wav, .mp3, etc.)


If, for whatever reason you wish to make a change or addition to any file in this repository that
you do not believe would be unanimous right away, feel free to create your own branch and/or fork this repository.
Try to name your branch or your fork as a play on the name "Okay, Super!"

For example, "Okay, Fwooper!" or "okay... super" or "hohkay, duper!"

We could spawn an infinite number of side projects using these same files, without requiring each core member to
directly partake in any of them.

Note that anything you add into this repository could be used in any side project variant of Okay, Super!
Still, remember that any updates to the officially named "Okay, Super!" must be UNANIMOUSLY approved.
